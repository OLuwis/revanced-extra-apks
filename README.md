### Introduction

This repo aims to expand and add more apps from the main [template repo](https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module).

It runs based on a scheduled pipeline on Github Actions at 00:00 UTC everyday, and then upload its updated files.

You can download its [latest release](https://github.com/OLuwis/revanced-extra-apks/releases/latest) from the "releases" page.

Currently for higher accessibility and compatibility i've made a base release for ARMV7 based smartphone, but there are still plans for other architectures and other patches.
