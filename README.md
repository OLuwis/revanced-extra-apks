### Introduction

This repo aims to expand and add more apps from the main [template repo](https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module).

It runs based on a scheduled pipeline on Github Actions at 00:00 UTC everyday, and then upload its updated files.

You can download its [latest release](https://github.com/OLuwis/revanced-extra-apks/releases/latest) from the "releases" page.

Currently for higher accessibility and compatibility i've made a base release for ARMV7 based smartphone, but there are still plans for other architectures and other patches.

### Using with Obtainium

Obtainium is an app that tracks updates for apps installed outside Google Play.

Obs: If you are going to use Obtainium for tracking releases and apks, activate "Verification for installed apps only" in settings, this way you don't suffer from rate limit.

1. Download Obtainium from their [Github](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/pt_BR/packages/dev.imranr.obtainium.fdroid/).

2. Download the export file from [here](https://github.com/OLuwis/revanced-extra-apks/blob/main/obtainium_armv7.json).

3. Open the app and then go to the import section, now click on import data and choose the import file (make sure its a JSON file).

This way you can import everything on your Obtainium app.
